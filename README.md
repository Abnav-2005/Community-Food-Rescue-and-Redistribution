# Community-Food-Rescue-and-Redistribution
A complete SQL + R Data Analysis project based on a real-world social problem: rescuing surplus food from restaurants/grocers and redistributing it to shelters and community fridges.

📌 Project Motivation

Food waste is a major global issue, while many communities struggle with food insecurity. This project models a simplified food redistribution network:

Donor → Volunteer → Shelter

Donors: Restaurants, grocers, cafeterias

Volunteers: People who pick up and deliver food

Shelters: Places that receive and distribute food

This system allows you to analyse:

How much food is collected

Which donors contribute the most

Which shelters receive the most

Volunteer performance

Food type distribution

Time trends & discrepancies
